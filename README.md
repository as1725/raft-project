# Raft Consensus Implementation

A robust implementation of the Raft distributed consensus algorithm in Go, designed for building fault-tolerant distributed systems. This implementation follows the Raft paper's specifications while providing a clean, modular architecture for practical applications.

## Overview

Raft is a consensus algorithm designed to be more understandable than Paxos while providing a complete foundation for building practical distributed systems. This implementation includes all core Raft features:

- Leader Election
- Log Replication
- Safety Guarantees
- Membership Changes
- Log Compaction

The project is structured to be both educational and production-ready, with extensive testing and clear separation of concerns.

## Core Components

### Raft Package

The `raft` package implements the core consensus protocol:

- **State Machine**: Manages transitions between Follower, Candidate, and Leader states
- **Log Management**: Handles command replication and consistency checking
- **RPC Handlers**:
  - `RequestVote`: Processes election requests
  - `AppendEntries`: Manages log replication and heartbeats
  - `InstallSnapshot`: Handles log compaction and state transfer

### KVRaft Package

A practical example of building a fault-tolerant service using Raft:

- **Client Interface**: Provides Put/Append/Get operations
- **Server Implementation**: Integrates with Raft for consistent state replication
- **State Machine**: Maintains the replicated key-value store

### LabRPC Package

A network simulation framework designed for testing distributed systems:

- Simulates network conditions (delays, partitions, reordering)
- Provides clean RPC interfaces
- Supports controlled testing of fault scenarios

## Implementation Details

### Leader Election

1. Followers monitor leader heartbeats using randomized timeouts
2. On timeout, a Follower transitions to Candidate state
3. Candidate increments term and requests votes from all peers
4. If majority votes received, becomes Leader
5. Leaders send periodic heartbeats to maintain authority

### Log Replication

1. Clients send commands to the Leader
2. Leader appends command to local log
3. Leader replicates entry to Followers via AppendEntries
4. Once majority confirms, Leader commits entry
5. Leader notifies clients of completion

### Safety Guarantees

- **Election Safety**: At most one leader per term
- **Log Matching**: If logs contain an entry with same index and term, all previous entries are identical
- **Leader Completeness**: Committed entries survive leader changes
- **State Machine Safety**: All replicas execute same commands in same order

## Usage Guide

### Server Initialization

```go
// Create a Raft server
rf := raft.Make(peers, me, persister, applyCh)

// Initialize KV store server
kv := kvraft.StartKVServer(servers, me, persister, maxraftstate)
```

### Client Operations

```go
// Create a new client
ck := kvraft.MakeClerk(servers)

// Perform operations
ck.Put("key", "value")
value := ck.Get("key")
ck.Append("key", "more-data")
```

### Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:

```bash
# Run basic tests
go test ./raft

# Run with race detection
go test -race ./raft

# Run specific test cases
go test -run TestInitialElection ./raft
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Batching**: Commands are batched for efficient replication
- **Log Compaction**: Automatic snapshotting prevents unbounded growth
- **Network Optimization**: Minimized RPC round trips
- **Concurrent Processing**: Leverages Go's goroutines for parallel operations

## Advanced Features

### Log Compaction

- Prevents unbounded log growth
- Periodic snapshot creation
- Efficient state transfer to slow followers

### Membership Changes

- Dynamic cluster reconfiguration
- Safe addition/removal of servers
- Joint consensus for configuration changes

### Persistence

- Durable storage of Raft state
- Crash recovery support
- Configurable storage backends

## Development Guidelines

### Best Practices

1. Use atomic operations for state updates
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Add detailed logging for debugging
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Handle all edge cases in RPCs

### Debugging Tips

- Enable verbose logging during development
- Use Go's race detector regularly
- Test with different network conditions
- Verify state machine consistency frequently

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Read-only query optimization
- [ ] Pre-vote protocol implementation
- [ ] Leadership transfer protocol
- [ ] Custom storage backend support
- [ ] Monitoring and metrics integration
